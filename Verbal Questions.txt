This Pointer
-> C++ contains a special pointer that is called this. This is a pointer that is called automatically passed to
   any member funcions when it is called, and it is a pointer to the object that generates the call.

Virtual Base Classes
Why do we use?
-> Virtual base classes used to avoid ambiguity in case of a class A is inherited by two or more than one class(es).
   In this case, the child class could have a duplicate sets of members and all of these sets are inherited from same base class.
   If a class is declared as virtual so all necessary cares will be taken to avoid duplications.
